# Learn

This repo has some of the stuff I've been learning. It's mostly shit tbh, but does the trick. Most projects here are either abandoned (specially UANL.Clases since it was an old repo for college and I fucking hated being there), in active development or creeping my mind every time I try to sleep (I can feel you ChucK). The most important and possibly the only i truly care about is Prototypes.GD since it has systems that i might reuse in other games down the line. They are not ment to be full projects on their own atm.
